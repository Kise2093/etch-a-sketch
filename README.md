## Project Post-Mortem ##

This project had taught me how to edit DOM by JavaScript and figuring out the relationship between child/parent DOM.
- Creating, appending, removing and setAttribute.

When I was just starting this project my first instinct was to use flex to create the grids, but after I've added the feature to increase the grid size the grid began to fall apart. The flexbox that was created began to spilled out from the parent container. After some deliberation I ended up using the "flex: grid" instead which was the perfect solution. The grid did not spilled out of the parent container like how flexbox did. In the end I was really satistfied with how this project looks. 

## Challenges ##

The challenge I ran into most often in this project was figuring out that flexbox cannot be use in this situation, so I have to use grid instead.
